## Installation

To run the Instagram AI Bot, follow these steps:

1. Clone the GitHub repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/instagram-ai-bot.git
```

2. Install the required Python packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up the appropriate API credentials for the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model and the Instagram API in the `config.json` file.

4. Run the Python program:

```
python main.py
```

## Usage

1. Initialize the `ImageVariationGenerator` class with the desired GPT-3 model name, for example:

```python
image_var_generator = ImageVariationGenerator("microsoft/DialoGPT-medium")
```

2. Generate image variations by calling the `generate_image_variations` method, providing the path to the image file:

```python
image_var_generator.generate_image_variations("path/to/image.png")
```

3. Retrieve the generated image variations using the `get_image_variations` method:

```python
image_variations = image_var_generator.get_image_variations()
```

4. Initialize the `ChatBot` class, passing the `ImageVariationGenerator` instance:

```python
chat_bot = ChatBot(image_var_generator)
```

5. Simulate a conversation with the bot by calling the `simulate_conversation` method and passing a conversation history:

```python
conversation = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm doing great, thanks for asking! How can I assist you today?"}
]
response = chat_bot.simulate_conversation(conversation)
```

6. Generate a response from the bot based on user input using the `generate_response` method:

```python
user_input = input(">> User: ")
response = chat_bot.generate_response(user_input)
print("DialoGPT: {}".format(response))
```

7. Engage with users by calling the `engage_with_users` method, specifying the number of lines to simulate:

```python
chat_bot.engage_with_users(5)
```
